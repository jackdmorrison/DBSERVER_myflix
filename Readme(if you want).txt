test to see if pollling is functioning and
while i am here i would like to explain that the previous repo this was contained in was https://github.com/jackdmorrison/myflix_react 
and was accessed through a sparse checkout. This
for some reason the docker-compose was not updating when items were pushed and caused me days of issues.
